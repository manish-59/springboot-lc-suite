# **!!LeetCode Suite!!**

This repository aims to have all question of LeetCode, with their respective solutions as service classes.
All such services have their own JUnit5 test classes, which can be used to run test cases, and to debug the code/solution.

Also, commonly used model classes are defined, which these services use. e.g. - TreeNode, Node, GraphNode etc.
